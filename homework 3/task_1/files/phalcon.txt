PHP C-extension (Phalcon)
C-extensions are loaded together with PHP one time on the web server’s daemon start process
Classes and functions provided by the extension are ready to use for any application
The code is compiled and isn’t interpreted because is already compiled to a specific platform and processor
Thanks to its low-level architecture and optimizations Phalcon provides the lowest overhead for MVC-based applications
